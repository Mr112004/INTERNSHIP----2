# 💼 **Data Science Internship Projects**

Welcome to my Data Science Internship repository! This space includes all the practical projects I've developed during my internship, tackling real-world problems using Python, machine learning, and data visualization. Each project walks through the end-to-end data science workflow — from cleaning data and building models to analyzing results and drawing insights.
SHORT SUMMARY OF THE PROJECT IS IN THE BOTTOM OF THE README FILE

## 📊 **Project Highlights**

### 1️⃣ **Iris Flower Classification**

**🧩 Objective:**
Classify different species of Iris flowers based on petal and sepal measurements.

**📂 Dataset:**
Built-in Iris dataset from `sklearn.datasets`.

**🧠 Model Used:**
Random Forest Classifier

**✅ Tasks Performed:**

* Loaded and explored the dataset using `pandas`
* Applied `train_test_split` and used cross-validation for model robustness
* Trained a Random Forest model and evaluated predictions
* Generated a structured classification report with precision, recall, and F1-score
* Predicted the species from a sample data point

**🔍 Use Case:**
Ideal for learning the basics of supervised classification and understanding model evaluation metrics.

### 2️⃣ **Car Price Prediction**

**🧩 Objective:**
Predict used car prices using attributes like brand, fuel type, year, mileage, and more.

**📂 Dataset:**
Cleaned and preprocessed dataset sourced from Kaggle.

**🧠 Models Used:**
Linear Regression and Random Forest Regressor

**✅ Tasks Performed:**

* Cleaned raw data and performed feature engineering
* Encoded categorical features using one-hot encoding
* Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) with visual insights
* Trained and validated regression models
* Evaluated model performance using RMSE and R² metrics

**🔍 Use Case:**
Useful for online car resale platforms or dealerships aiming to automate pricing systems.

### 3️⃣ **Sales Prediction Using Python**

**🧩 Objective:**
Forecast product sales based on advertising budget distribution across TV, Radio, and Newspaper.

**📂 Dataset:**
Advertising dataset containing marketing spend and corresponding sales.

**🧠 Model Used:**
Linear Regression

**✅ Tasks Performed:**

* Visualized feature relationships to spot trends and correlations
* Built a linear regression model and made predictions
* Evaluated the model using MAE, RMSE, and R²
* Interpreted which media platforms contribute most to sales

**🔍 Use Case:**
Supports marketing teams in budget allocation and return-on-investment analysis.
